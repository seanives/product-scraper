# product-scraper

> A sample java console application.

This project is a sample Java console application which scrapes a portion of the Sainsburyâ€™s Groceries website.

The rationale behind the structure of this project is to make components reusable and testable. To achieve this I implemented a presenter/coordinator pattern that outlines all the possible error and success responses from each processing component (parsing, data aggregation, and reporting).  Each component is completely separated from each of the others, with the presenter forming a contract between components with different responsibilities.

The source of the implemented presenter can be found [here](https://github.com/seanives/product-scraper/blob/master/src/main/java/com/seanives/productscraper/presenter/ProductPresenter.java).
